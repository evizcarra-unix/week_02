# week_02# Overview

The following is an arcade game using the foundational files from the platform tutorial found on [arcade.academy](https://arcade.academy/). It's a simple Mario-like scrolling game with the use of the 'W'-'A'-'S'-'D' keyboards. It'll render the appropiate length and width to be playable and will give the player no hassle with the automatic scroll with the character.

The entire purpose is for educational use with those around me. It provides a greater understanding as to what can be created using the arcade library in Python. Additionally, the overall schemes are a great way of exposing individuals interested in programming video games whether simple or complex ones.
